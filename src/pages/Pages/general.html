    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <h5>Type</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When selecting URL, it'll read the URLs of the tabs and group against
        that
      </li>
      <li>
        When selecting Title, it'll read the title attribute of the tabs and
        group against that.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Contains</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Write what you want to match against. If you picked "title" for Type,
        and you want to match YouTube tabs about cats, you might put "cats". If
        you picked "URL" for Type, and you want to match all Youtube tabs, you
        might put "youtube"
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Case Sensitive</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        URLs and Titles can be tricky to match against, by default this option
        is off to ensure the best user experience. If you do need stricter
        rules, you can enable this
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Regex</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can enable this and in the "Contains" input field write regular
        expressions. For example, if you want to group social media tabs
        together you might enable this and put
        "facebook|twitter|instagram|tiktok" in the "Contains" field
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Group Name</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The name of the tab in the browser</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Color</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The color of the tab in the browser</li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Auto-Group</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>"Created Tab" will group tabs when they are created, duplicated</li>
      <li>
        "Updated Tab" will group tabs when they are updated, by title or URL.
        This would run on page changes for example
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Apply</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>By default enabled, this turns on/off this rule</li>
    </ul>
